Mandelbrot stuff
================

My struggle with the mandelbrot set.

For now I just uploaded a bunch of code I had. But I plan to comment out the codes.
There is a python version and a C version, which both does the same.
There is also a C version using GMP for better precision, so we can zoom further, way in.
